This research bridges the gap between continuous and discrete models, it delivers a powerful framework for modeling complex phenomena across time, space, and logic. With this integration, engineers and scientists can tackle hybrid challenges—such as cyber‑physical systems and smart infrastructure—through a single, coherent approach.
